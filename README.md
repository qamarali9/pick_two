# pick_two (Interview Problem)
The following coding problem :
    There is bag that contains 3 colours of ball (Red, Green & Blue).
    Numbers of ball count of each colours are A, B, and C respectively.
    We will have 3 picks and in each pick we will take 2 balls out and we won’t replace the picked balls for subsequent picks or draws.
    We wanted to find out the probability of picking balls of same colour in 3rd draw.
    You are NOT allowed to use “conditional probability” formulae to solve this, instead solve algorithmically using data structure.
